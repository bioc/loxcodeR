\usage{
rank_count_plot(x, size, ymax, dmax)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{loxcode sample object}

\item{size}{loxcode size to consider}

\item{ymax}{max y-value for counts}

\item{dmax}{max d-value for dist_orig}
}
\description{
In the resulting plot, barcodes of specified size are ranked by read count. log10(count) is then plotted
against barcode rank in black. In addition, dist_orig for each barcode is shown in red with the same horizontal axis.

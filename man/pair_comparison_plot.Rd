\usage{
pair_comparison_plot(lox, set, codeset = "all_codes", x1, x2, range, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{lox}{loxcode experiment object of current experiment}

\item{set}{sample set of current experiment}

\item{codeset}{code set of current experiment}

\item{x1}{loxcode_sample object for sample 1}

\item{x2}{loxcode_sample object for sample 2}

\item{range}{c(lower, upper), specifying the range of dist_orig values to consider. Both bounds are inclusive.}
}
\value{
A plot of 2 loxcode samples being compared
}
\description{
For each barcode in x1, x2, read counts in each sample are plotted on a log-scale, after adjusting sample x2 to match the total read count (for valid barcodes) in sample x1. Barcodes present in one sample and not the other are shown horizontally and vertically (below 0) using beeswarm plots
